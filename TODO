- show ball count
- slider for max balls
- slider to scale damage
- slider to scale gravity
- slider for time scale
- replace canvas with 3js (or something similar)
- add gravity between objects
- create a nice compact combo slider object w/ name and value
- reintroduce particles
- modify vec functions to default to copying and add <function>Equals functions to support inline operations
this will help with getting results correct and we can worry about optimization later
